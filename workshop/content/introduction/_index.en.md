A very common use case is that organizations often look at their customers from different
perspectives, such as Loyalty perspective, looking at metrics like: years of history,
frequency of interaction, or a demographic perspective like stage of life or income. We
call them dimensions, and we will combine several dimensions about your customer to
give you more visibility of several perspectives at the same time.
In this blog we will explore a hypothetic financial services company, as there are
common dimensions for this industry and some dimensions that are also valid for any
service industry, like marketing and communications, customer history or demographic
dimension.
