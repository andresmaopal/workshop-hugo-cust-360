#### Now you are going to perform more advanced transformations using AWS Glue job, first using python shell, then with Pyspark.


AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy to prepare and load your data for analytics. You can create and run an ETL job with a few clicks in the AWS Glue visual editor. 

####How it works

Select a data source and data target in AWS Glue. AWS Glue will generate Apache Spark ETL code in Scala or Python to extract data from the source, transform the data to match the target schema, and load it into the target. You can edit, debug and test this code in the AWS Glue visual interface, your favorite IDE, or any notebook.
