WS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy to prepare and load your data for analytics. You can create and run an ETL job with a few clicks in the AWS Glue visual editor.

Glue will generate ETL code in Scala or Python to extract data from the source, transform the data to match the target schema, and load it into the target. You can edit, debug and test this code via the Console, in your favorite IDE, or any notebook.
