## Deploy CloudFormation template to create basic infrastructure


**Step 1:** Download Cloudformation template [cf-360view.yaml : Right click here and Save Link as File.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/build-a-360-degree-customer-view-with-aws/master/cloudformation/cf-360view.yaml)

The template has created the following resources to optimize your time.
3 Amazon S3 buckets:
*	RawDataS3Bucket
*	StageDataS3Bucket
*	AnalyticsDataS3Bucket

1 RDS instance with PostgreSQL database to simulate your transaction database.
*	RDSSource – sourcemf

6 Lambda functions to generate data for different source.
*	c360viewCRMApi
*	c360viewGetCRMApi
*	c360viewGetGaTables
*	c360viewMFgenAccount
*	c360viewMFgenCard
*	c360viewMFgenGBank
5 CloudWatch events schedules, to trigger the Lambda functions.

2 Security group, firewalls, one for the EC2 instance, other for Replication instances and Lambda functions.

1 Role for the AWS Lambda functions
1 Role for the AWS Glue

1 Amazon EMR cluster

Check the status of each resource, and order by resource status.


If the resource Type “AWS::RDS::DBInstance” and “AWS::EMR::Cluster” are the only with status CREATE_IN_PROGRESS, and all the others are CREATE_COMPLETE you can continue the execution.
