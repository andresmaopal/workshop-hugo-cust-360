Notice that as we had CSV without header the name of the columns where crawled as col0 to col3 in the RAW data.
You can edit this on AWS Glue, but our jobs to processed the data in Step Functions are already aware of it.

If you go to c360view_stage database you will find a different scenario.

**Step 9:** Check the other tables data and then go to the c360view_stage database.
